# Multitasking-Research
This is a web application that prompts users to complete a variety of tasks.  Each user will have the same tasks, however they may vary in difficulty and some users may be required to complete more than one task simultaneously.  The purpose of this is to research the effects of multitasking on performance.  The data was gathered with PHP and the tasks were implemented using javascript.  For more information, please read the research abstract.

If the application does not grant you access, please try changing the workerID in the url.
